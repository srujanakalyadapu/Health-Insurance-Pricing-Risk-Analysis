# Health-Insurance-Pricing-Risk-Analysis
This project delves into the dynamics of health insurance costs in the US, focusing on the influence of preexisting medical conditions, dietary habits, and lifestyle choices. It seeks to assist insurance providers by developing premiums, reserve funds, and risk profiles tailored to individual health and lifestyle metrics.

## Business Problem
The core challenge tackled by this study is the complexity of predicting and managing health insurance costs against the backdrop of diverse and sometimes imbalanced health risk factors, such as lifestyle choices and medical history. The aim is to enhance the accuracy of premium setting and risk profiling to mitigate potential financial losses for insurers and reduce premium costs for families.

## Methodology
The methodology involves comprehensive data analysis using three key datasets:
* Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Prediction Dataset: Examines the relationship between lifestyle factors and cardiovascular disease risks.
* US Health Insurance Dataset: Analyzes the factors influencing health insurance premiums and the impact of insured attributes on policy costs.
* US CDC Obesity Prevalence Dataset: Investigates regional obesity trends and their implications on health insurance.
The project employs visual analytics tools, notably Tableau, to integrate these datasets and identify attributes that correlate with higher insurance premiums. Techniques include demographic and health status analysis, BMI sensitivity assessments, and region-specific premium adjustments.

## Results and Conclusion
The analysis from the project provided significant insights into how lifestyle factors and geographical disparities impact health insurance premiums. Key findings and strategic recommendations include:
* Gender-Based Pricing: The analysis highlighted minimal differences in insurance claims between genders, suggesting a more nuanced approach to gender-based pricing might be necessary, particularly considering sex-specific health needs that were not fully captured in the datasets.
* Lifestyle and Health: Findings suggested that while lifestyle choices like alcohol consumption minimally impact BMI and consequently insurance claims, promoting healthier behaviors such as regular exercise could significantly mitigate higher claim risks.
* Diabetes Impact: The study underscored the higher likelihood of insurance claims among individuals with diabetes, especially those who do not frequently visit hospitals. Implementing routine health checkups during the insurance application process could help in identifying and managing high-risk individuals effectively.
* Region-Specific Policies: Insurance premiums showed variation across different states, with some correlations to state-specific BMI averages. This indicates potential for regionally tailored insurance policies that could incentivize healthier lifestyles, potentially lowering premiums and improving overall health outcomes.
* Policy Recommendations: Based on the trends observed, insurance companies are encouraged to consider more personalized insurance plans that factor in individual health conditions and lifestyle choices more comprehensively. This approach could help in accurately pricing premiums and reducing the financial burden on both the insurer and the insured.
These conclusions and recommendations provide a foundation for insurance providers to refine their risk assessments and pricing strategies, aligning them more closely with individual health metrics and regional health trends to foster a more equitable and efficient health insurance system.
